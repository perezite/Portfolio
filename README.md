In Switzerland, every chauffeur conducting a livestock transport is required by law to carry a document during all stages of the transport: The so called accompanying document. It contains information like the number of transported animals and the duration of the transport, ensuring compliance with Swiss animal protection laws and therefore helping to increase animal welfare.  

In the past, the accompanying document had to be printed on paper, carried around and filled in physically. This was a tedious and error prone process. The eTransit app allows farmers and chauffeurs to easily create and manage their accompanying documents using their mobile phone.

The system is also accompanied by a web app, allowing the user to inspect and manage their created documents.

SmartCow is a mobile app for cattle herd management, developed by [Identitas AG](https://www.identitas.ch/) on behalf of [Swissgenetics](https://swissgenetics.ch/).

ðŸ”— [Android App Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.swissgenetics.smartcow)

The SmartCow app enables farmers to manage their cattle herd using their mobile phone.

The app offers a digital rutting calendar for cattle, including an automatic synchronisation of livestock data from the Swiss animal traffic database (Tierverkehrsdatenbank), of which every Swiss farmer is a member.

It is also possible to notify the Swiss animal traffic database about several livestock events like the birth or death of a cattle. Furthermore the app connects to several cattle breeding organization systems, giving for example access to milk performance data of individual animals in the livestock.

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Further develop and extend the existing backend in **ASP.NET WebAPI**

## Tierverkehrsdatenbank (Swiss Animal Traffic Database)

<img src="https://www.identitas.ch/fileadmin/_processed_/6/4/csm_header_schaf_f7a948ba59.jpg" alt="TVD Image"/>

The 'Tierverkehrsdatenbank' (TVD) is the central Swiss animal traffic database for animal based food safety and disease control in Switzerland. The system is developed an maintained by [Identitas AG](https://www.identitas.ch/) on behalf of the Swiss government.

ðŸ”— [Product Landing Page](https://www.identitas.ch/produkte/tierverkehrsdatenbank-tvd)  

Farmers can use a web app to register different events in their livestock like animals leaving or arriving at their farm, birth or death of animals as well as various other events.  
This data can be used for disease control in the case of an animal disease outbreak and is also used to ensure meat food safety in Switzerland.  
Registering at the TVD is mandatory for Swiss farmers keeping cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.

### My contribution to the project
ðŸ’¡ Migrate the old and outdated Silverlight frontend to a fully web based frontend using **ASP.NET MVC**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **jQuery**.

# Personal and University Projects

## Tank Game

![Tank Game Screenshot](https://github.com/perezite/tank-game/raw/main/assets/screenshot1.png)

ðŸ”— [Github Repository](https://github.com/perezite/tank-game)  
ðŸ”— [Download Page](https://github.com/perezite/tank-game/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

An action game where a tank must fight its way through a 3D city full of hostile enemy tanks.

This game was created as a final project during the lecture
'[Computer Graphics Lab](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/computer-graphics-fs20.html)' at the University of Zurich, in cooperation with two fellow students.

The goal of the project was the implementation of a functioning video game in a group of three during a time period of three weeks.
Due to the tight time constraint, the game still contains various bugs like a quirky enemy ai, clipping errors and missing textures.

My assignment in the project group was the implementation of the ballistics for grenades and projectiles, the implementation of the particle systems as well as the programming of a fast and precise collision detection.

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Implement particle systems rendering  
ðŸ’¡ Develop a fast and precise collision detection  
ðŸ’¡ Implement ballistics for the grenades and projectiles  

### Project details:
ðŸ‘· Team size: ~3 people  
âŒš Collaboration timeframe: 3 week project during spring semester 2011

An Arkanoid inspired action game, made with the Unity 3D Engine.

This was my biggest personal project in Unity 3D so far. Code and graphics were all created by myself. To create the graphics, I used the open source vector graphics software Inkscape.  
I really wanted to make a self-containted, complete game with production quality - which I think I have succeeded in. I even took some time off from my regular job to learn Unity 3D and complete this project! Finally, I published the app to the Android app store.

The original Android version (not available anymore) contained some commercially licensed external content. To avoid copyright issues, I replaced these textures / music clips with placeholders in the downloadable Windows version above. This means, that some texture have - let's say varying quality (in other words: some things look really ugly, especially in the main menu...). Thank you for your understanding.

### My contribution to the project

Pretty much everything was made by myself:  
ðŸ’¡ Create and code the game using **Unity 3D** and **C#**  
ðŸ’¡ Create most of the graphics assets using graphics software like **Inkscape** and **Gimp**   
ðŸ’¡ Remix free music and sound clips using the audio software **Audacity**
