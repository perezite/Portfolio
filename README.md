eTransit is a mobile app created by [Identitas AG](https://www.identitas.ch)
In Switzerland, every chauffeur conducting a livestock transport is required by law to carry a document during all stages of the transport: The so called accompanying document. It contains information like the number of transported animals and the duration of the transport, ensuring compliance with Swiss animal protection laws and therefore helping to increase animal welfare.  

In the past, the accompanying document had to be printed on paper, carried around and filled in physically. This was a tedious and error prone process. The eTransit app allows farmers and chauffeurs to easily create an accompanying document and fill in the required information using their mobile phone.

The system is also accompanied by a web app, allowing the user to inspect and manage their created documents.
