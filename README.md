In Switzerland, every chauffeur conducting a livestock transport is required by law to carry a document during all stages of the transport: The so called accompanying document. It contains information like the number of transported animals and the duration of the transport, ensuring compliance with Swiss animal protection laws and therefore helping to increase animal welfare.  

In the past, the accompanying document had to be printed on paper, carried around and filled in physically. This was a tedious and error prone process. The eTransit app allows farmers and chauffeurs to easily create and manage their accompanying documents using their mobile phone.

The system is also accompanied by a web app, allowing the user to inspect and manage their created documents.

SmartCow is a mobile app for cattle herd management, developed by [Identitas AG](https://www.identitas.ch/) on behalf of [Swissgenetics](https://swissgenetics.ch/).

The SmartCow app enables farmers to manage their cattle herd using their mobile phone.

The app offers a digital rutting calendar for cattle, including an automatic synchronisation of livestock data from the Swiss animal traffic database (Tierverkehrsdatenbank), of which every Swiss farmer is a member.

It is also possible to notify the Swiss animal traffic database about several livestock events like the birth or death of a cattle. Furthermore the app connects to several cattle breeding organization systems, giving for example access to milk performance data of individual animals in the livestock.
