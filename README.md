In Switzerland, every chauffeur conducting a livestock transport is required by law to carry a document during all stages of the transport: The so called accompanying document. It contains information like the number of transported animals and the duration of the transport, ensuring compliance with Swiss animal protection laws and therefore helping to increase animal welfare.  

In the past, the accompanying document had to be printed on paper, carried around and filled in physically. This was a tedious and error prone process. The eTransit app allows farmers and chauffeurs to easily create and manage their accompanying documents using their mobile phone.

The system is also accompanied by a web app, allowing the user to inspect and manage their created documents.

ðŸ”— [Github Repository](https://github.com/perezite/tank-game)  
ðŸ”— [Download Page](https://github.com/perezite/tank-game/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

An action game where a tank must fight its way through a 3D city full of hostile enemy tanks.

This game was created as a final project during the lecture
'[Computer Graphics Lab](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/computer-graphics-fs20.html)' at the University of Zurich, in cooperation with two fellow students.

The goal of the project was the implementation of a functioning video game in a group of three during a time period of three weeks.
Due to the tight time constraint, the game still contains various bugs like a quirky enemy ai, clipping errors and missing textures.

My assignment in the project group was the implementation of the ballistics for grenades and projectiles, the implementation of the particle systems as well as the programming of a fast and precise collision detection.

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Implement particle systems rendering  
ðŸ’¡ Develop a fast and precise collision detection  
ðŸ’¡ Implement ballistics for the grenades and projectiles

An Arkanoid inspired action game, made with the Unity 3D Engine.

This was my biggest personal project in Unity 3D so far. Code and graphics were all created by myself. To create the graphics, I used the open source vector graphics software Inkscape.  
I really wanted to make a self-containted, complete game with production quality - which I think I have succeeded in. I even took some time off from my regular job to learn Unity 3D and complete this project! Finally, I published the app to the Android app store.

The original Android version (not available anymore) contained some commercially licensed external content. To avoid copyright issues, I replaced these textures / music clips with placeholders in the downloadable Windows version above. This means, that some texture have - let's say varying quality (in other words: some things look really ugly, especially in the main menu...). Thank you for your understanding.

### My contribution to the project

Pretty much everything was made by myself:  
ðŸ’¡ Create and code the game using **Unity 3D** and **C#**  
ðŸ’¡ Create most of the graphics assets using graphics software like **Inkscape** and **Gimp**   
ðŸ’¡ Remix free music and sound clips using the audio software **Audacity**

ðŸ”— [Download Page (Windows and Android) (Example game made with O2 Game Engine)](https://github.com/perezite/o2-blocks/releases/)

**O2** is a C++ cross-platform 2D game engine. It currently supports Android and Windows.

The engine is strongly influenced by **SFML**. SFML does not officially support mobile platforms, however. I dedided to roll my own engine and use **SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer)** as a basis for the platform dependent functionality (like input/ouptut and window creation). The rendering is done in **OpenGL** / **OpenGL ES**, without using abstractions from SDL.
The game is fully integrated into Visua Studio, i.e. the game can be built and debugged from within Visual studio for both Windows and Android.

After tinkering with the engine code for quite some time, I decided to create an actual self-contained game with it. So I created a game called **O2 Blocks** - see screenshots. It's something similiar to Tetris, but with over-the-top effects and explosions (which are not really visible in the screenshots). The game also features the supposedly most annoying sound effects in the history of mankind ðŸ˜‹... I created these sound effects with the audio generator software **SFXR**.

I strive to continuously improve the code add new functionality to the engine. At the time of writing, I am refactoring the audio code to use the audio library [**miniaudio**](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio), instead of the dated SDL audio capabilities which are currently in use. I also plan to move the engine code, which currently lives only inside the game, to a dedicated repository and include it using [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/de/v2/Git-Tools-Submodule).

The 2D engine currently supports the following features  
- Cross-platform on Windows and Android
- Fully integrated into Visual Studio
- Batched 2D texture rendering using OpenGL
- Input/Output handling (mouse, keyboard, mobile touch screen)
- Logging
- Animation system using [tweens (also called easings)](http://robertpenner.com/easing/)
- Camera system
- Particle systems
- Music and Sound playback

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Create the O2 game engine code based on **SDL**, using **OpenGL** and **C++**  
ðŸ’¡ Create the tetris-inspired game **O2 Blocks**, based on the O2 Game Engine

You are a simple Space-Engineer shortly before finishing his last day at work and being off to retirement as the phone rings and he is handed down one small last task. An A.I. on the interstellar defense platform "N3-BUL-0N" has gone mad and threatens to destroy planet earth. 
Being the one with the most experience, you are entrusted in reaching the platform's core and pull the plug.  
If only it were that easy... 

This game was created during the [Global Game Jam 2015](https://globalgamejam.org/) by two fellow game creators and me in one weekend. It's a puzzle game where you have to make your way through various maze-like levels by activating switches which in turn open doors in order to reach the exit.

A web-based application for accounting and billing, tailored to the specific needs of a gamehoster company.

Clan Manager is a web-based application for managing and billing clients (called gaming clans) of a gamehoster company.

The application features the following functions:

- Specify information about the clans, including name, contact information and accounting number
- Specify information about the operated gameservers, including server name, IP address, optional discount information, pricing, terms of payment etc.
- Assign gameservers to clans
- Suspend/Reactivate the operation of gameservers
- Track the payments made by the clans, including highlighting when payments or demand notes are due
- A slick PHP web interface

I created Clan Manager for friends who where getting into the gameserver hosting business at this time. This was back when we were all in highschool. They needed a software to manage their customers, so I created an app in PHP to support their business. It was the first time I actually made some money with writing software!

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Create a small customer management software in **PHP** and **MySQL**

## 2D Rigid Body Physics Simulation

![Rigid Body Screenshot](https://github.com/perezite/rigid-body/blob/main/docs/screenshots/RigidBodyScreenshot2.png?raw=true)

ðŸ”— [Github Repository](https://github.com/perezite/rigid-body)  
ðŸ”— [Download Page (Windows)](hhttps://github.com/perezite/rigid-body/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  

This program is a 2D physics simulation, inspired by the [Rigid Body Dynamics Tutorial by Chris Hecker](https://www.chrishecker.com/Rigid_Body_Dynamics)

The program simulates a freely movable two dimensional cube which hangs on two ropes. The end of one rope can be moved around using the mouse.  
The two ropes can be toggled on or off. If you set them to off, the cube will fall to the ground in a physically accurate way.  

### My contribution to the project

ðŸ’¡ Implement a simple **2D rigid body physics** simulation and 2D rendering in **OpenGL**

Two arcade game clones I made with the SDL and with the SFML game library, respectively.  
Nothing fancy, just two basic clones of Tetris and Breakout.  
These projects were my first attempts at using SDL and SFML. Especially the clean and simple api of SFML piqued my interest in game libraries and game programming in general.

### My contribution to the projects

ðŸ’¡ Implement a Tetris clone in **C++** and **SDL**  
ðŸ’¡ Implement a Breakout clone in **C++** and **SFDML**
